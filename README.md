# WebDev-More

In this repository I store examples and snippets of code related to more advanced topics such as frameworks new features (React.js, Angular etc), new CSS3 properties, ES6-ES7 Java script additions, graphQL, D3 and other web technologies I am interested in at some moment.

I like to refer to some of these "experiments" when I have to work on new projects.
